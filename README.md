## LIGHTBnB

Lightbnb is a project for the web dev flex program at Lighthouse Labs

## WHAT I DID

-- Design the database and create an ERD for the tables.
-- Create the database and the tables using the ERD.
-- Add fake data to the database to make testing queries easier.
-- Write queries.
-- Connect the database to a JavaScript application in order to interact with the data from a web page.

## WHAT I LEARNED

-- Explain the importance and application of SQL/relational databases for web applications.
-- Describe the key components that make up a relational database.
-- Design database tables using primary and foreign keys correctly.
-- Determine if a data model should use one-to-many or many-to-many relationships when designing relational databases.
-- Utilize SELECT statements to solve common data query questions involving GROUP BY, WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER.
-- Utilize CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE statements to modify existing database table structure and records.
-- Use JOIN statements to combine information from related tables to build more complex result sets.
-- Use asynchronous (promise-based) postgres JS libraries to query data from Node applications.
-- Use the psql CLI to interact with and explore a database.
-- Research database queries through documentation and other references.
